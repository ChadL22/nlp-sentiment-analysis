# NLP Sentiment Analysis: Model Mechanics & Mathematics

A comprehensive exploration of sentiment analysis model architecture, mathematical foundations, and internal processes. This repository serves as an educational resource for understanding how popular sentiment analysis models work under the hood.

## üîç Featured Models

### VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- **Type**: Lexicon and rule-based model
- **Specialization**: Social media text and short-form content
- **Key features**: Handles slang, emojis, punctuation emphasis, and contextual modifiers

### RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)
- **Type**: Transformer-based deep learning model
- **Specialization**: Complex contextual understanding and long-form text
- **Key features**: Self-attention mechanisms, transfer learning, contextual embeddings

## üìä Model Comparison

| Aspect | VADER | RoBERTa |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Approach | Rule-based, lexicon-driven | Transformer-based, data-driven |
| Context Handling | Heuristic rules (e.g., "but") | Self-attention captures long-range context |
| Training | No training required | Pre-training + task-specific fine-tuning |
| Slang/Emojis | Explicitly coded in lexicon | Learns from data (if present in training) |
| Interpretability | High (transparent rules) | Low (black-box model) |
| Computational Cost | Very low | High (requires GPU for efficient inference) |
| Performance on Long Texts | Limited | Excellent (up to max sequence length) |
